# Get Fit Exercise App
The Get Fit exercise app was a capstone project that 3 classmates and I worked on during our We Can Code It Coding boot camp. I developed the backend on my own using Spring Boot and H2 Database and I assisted my teammates with the front end using React, Flowbite, and Tailwind. We also used Axios to connect the front end and back end.

# Implementation After Bootcamp
I have decided to take this project and expound on it. I am implementing the use of PostgreSQL for the database and adding more functionality to the front end.
