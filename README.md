# Get Fit Exercise App
The Get Fit exercise app was a project that I worked on with three classmates during our We Can Code It Coding boot camp. It allows users to sign in and choose from a variety of exercises across multiple workout options. I developed the backend and helped my teammates with the front end.

## Tech Used
React, Flowbite, Tailwind, Spring Boot, H2 Database, Axios

# Implementation After Bootcamp
Since completing the boot camp, I have decided to continue working on the project and make some improvements. For instance, I plan to refactor the React code to follow best practices such as using components instead of including code inside pages. I implemented PostgreSQL, and also plan to optimize the Java code.

## New Tech Used
PostgreSQL
