# Get Fit Exercise App
The Get Fit exercise app was a fun capstone project that 3 classmates and I worked on during our We Can Code It Coding boot camp. I developed the backend and I assisted my teammates with the front end.

## Tech Used
React, Flowbite, Tailwind, Spring Boot, H2 Database, Axios

# Implementation After Bootcamp
I have decided to take this project and expound on it by refactoring the React code to follow common practices such as using components instead of code inside of pages, implementing an external database like PostgreSQL, and finding where I can make the Java code better.

## New Tech Used
PostgreSQL
